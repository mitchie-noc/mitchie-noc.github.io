## Publications
### Effective use of evolutionary computation to parameterize an epidemiological model
(January 2021)

This paper was submitted as part of [CIBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Computational_Intelligence_Methods_for_Bioinformatics_and_Biostatistics) 2019. It followed on from my undergraduate dissertation which envolved the construction of
a computational model of the HPV virus and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with the ultimate aim of predicting the outcomes of varying control techniques.
Genetic algorithms and partical swarm optimization was applied to this model to optimise 8 real value parameters.

Prediction of gender-neutral vaccination with the tuned model suggests elimination of the virus across vaccinated and cross-protected strains, supporting recent Scottish government policy.
